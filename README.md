# The Two Towers

In this project, I used iterators to solve a computationally complex problem, which is posed as follows: Suppose that we are given n uniquely-sized cubic blocks and that each block has a face area between 1 and n. If we build two towers by stacking these blocks, how close can we make their heights?
